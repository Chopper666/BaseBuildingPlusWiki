      Re-sized all base parts to a universal size. Placement and snapping should be much better now.
      Added missing metal upgrade options to full frame and half frame. Temporary fix: Use a Hatchet to
      upgrade the half frame to metal and a Hammer to upgrade to wood.
      Fixed workbench spawning on it's side.
      2 missing items added to types.xml (the last 2 in the file, BBP_Simple_Floor_Hatch_Frame and BBP_Simple_Floor_Hatch_Stairs).
